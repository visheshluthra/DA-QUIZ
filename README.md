# DA-QUIZ
It is a quiz that checks the players javascript knowledge and has also questions on the best programming tips and practices!
So I have combined 2 topics in one project.

Now this project has 5 pages. Although I have yet to finish the project. I have well completed only 1.5 pages and the js is ready but it needs to be linked with the html doc.
The 5 pages are:
*main page (which i like to call the influencer page hahaXD)
*Instruction
*Rate us
*leaderBoard
*Platform

So the pages will be connected to the maiin page.
Instruction page will have the instructions of the quiz.
Then we move to the quiz which allows navigation among questions.
then we have the leaderboard and the platform page which suggests platforms to the users to learn various programming languages AND FINLLY RATE US WHERE YOU RATE THE GAME AND THE QUESTIONS.
